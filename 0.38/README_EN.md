# Upcoming Update Information for Pose Analysis 0.38

This version is scheduled for release on **June 13, 2025**.  
Please note that it includes **breaking changes**.  
There are also **price revisions**, so please read through to the end.

## Breaking Changes to CSV Specifications

In this version, the CSV format has undergone major changes.  
The iOS app and web dashboard for version 0.38 support this new format.  
However, CSV files generated by older versions will no longer be compatible.  
The same applies to the web dashboard — CSVs from previous versions cannot be loaded.  

Details of the new format are explained below.

### Sample

[Download here](./sample_v0.38.csv)

### Structure of Output CSV Files

- `raw.csv`  
  - The main CSV file containing raw pose estimation data  
  - Also includes coordinates smoothed by the OneEuroFilter  
    - The OneEuroFilter is a type of low-pass filter used to reduce noise and produce smoother motion

- `angles.csv`  
  - Converts the raw `X`, `Y`, `Z` values from `raw.csv` into joint angles

- `one_euro_angles.csv`  
  - Converts the OneEuro-filtered `OneEuroX`, `OneEuroY`, `OneEuroZ` values from `raw.csv` into joint angles

### Details of `raw.csv` Format

#### First 3 Header Columns

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `elapsed`   | Elapsed time in milliseconds since start |
| `frame`     | Frame number |
| `score`     | Overall confidence score of pose estimation (0.0–1.0) |

---

#### Structure for Each Joint

Each joint has the following 7 fields:

| Suffix       | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `Score`      | Confidence score for the joint (0.0–1.0) |
| `X`, `Y`, `Z`| 3D coordinates in space |
| `OneEuroX`, `OneEuroY`, `OneEuroZ` | Coordinates smoothed by OneEuroFilter |

**Note:** 3D coordinates range from -224 to 224, with the center as the origin.  
- X increases to the right  
- Y increases upward  
- Z increases toward the back  

The OneEuroFilter is a type of low-pass filter used to reduce noise and create smoother motion.
