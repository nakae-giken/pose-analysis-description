## Changes to CSV Format (`raw.csv`) (Breaking Change)

In this version, the CSV format—especially `raw.csv`—has been significantly updated.  
Both the iOS app and the Web Dashboard in version 0.38 are compatible with the new format.  
However, **CSV files generated by previous versions will no longer be supported**.  
This applies to the Web Dashboard as well.  
Older CSV files will not be readable by the updated system.

Below is a detailed explanation of the new format.

### Joint Data Structure

Each joint is represented by the following 7 fields:

| Suffix       | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| `Score`      | Confidence score for the specific joint (0.0 to 1.0) |
| `X`, `Y`, `Z`| 3D position in space (unit depends on the model; typically normalized) |
